# wfc-tiles

This is a fork of [https://github.com/Arkyris/blazinwfc](https://github.com/Arkyris/blazinwfc),
an implementation of the Wave Function Collapse simple tiled model. It can be
used to generate tilemaps procedurally.

Read the [original readme](https://github.com/Arkyris/blazinwfc#readme) most of
which still applies, and see the types for the rest of the details.
